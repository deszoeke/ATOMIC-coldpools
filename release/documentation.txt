CONTEXTUAL INFORMATION
-------------------

1. Abstract for the dataset

Matlab and Julia functions plot analyses of observations below
shallow cumulus clouds, demonstrating the 
meteorological, thermodynamic, and isotopic signals in 
atmospheric cold pools observed at the surface in the
2020 ATOMIC / EUREC4A-iso field campaign.
Vapor evaporated from rain and ocean water is modeled.
Water vapor in strong cold pools, associated with rain are enriched in heavy
isotopes, suggesting evaporation of rain enriches air in evaporatively
cooled downdrafts that generate them.


2. Context of the research project that this dataset was collected for.

The programs were written to analyze data from EUREC4A-iso,
and to provide general meteorological, thermodynamic, and 
physical insight on cloud and precipitation processes.

-----------------------------------------
CODE-SPECIFIC INFORMATION: 
-----------------------------------------

1. Installation 
We recommend installing juliaup or the Julia binaries from https://julialang.org/downloads/.

We installed a Julia (v.1.10.4) 
Jupyter kernel using IJulia (v.1.24.2).
We ran Jupyter notebooks in Microsoft Visual Studio Code v.1.90.1
with the Jupyter VSCode extension v2024.5.0.

2. Requirements
The calculations depend on Julia packages. 
Specific packages installed are in `Project.toml`:

DataFrames = "a93c6f00-e57d-5684-b7b6-d8193f3e46c0"
ForwardDiff = "f6369f11-7733-5829-9624-2563aa707210"
Interpolations = "a98d9a8b-a2ab-59e6-89dd-64a1c18fca59"
Latexify = "23fbe1c1-3f47-55db-b15f-69d7ec21a316"
NCDatasets = "85f8d34a-cbdd-5861-8df4-14fed0d494ab"
Printf = "de0858da-6303-5e67-8744-51eddeeeb8d7"
Psychro = "9516f557-4a54-5a79-b954-c272e753c77a"
PyPlot = "d330b81b-6aea-500a-939a-2ce795aea3ee"
Revise = "295af30f-e4ad-537b-8983-00126c2a3abe"
Statistics = "10745b16-79ce-11e8-11f9-7d13ad32a3b2"
Unitful = "1986cc42-f94f-5a68-af5c-568840ba703d"

We recommend installing your own up-to-date set of the dependencies
by default with the package manager. (This is what the authors do.)
To do so, start Julia in the working directory and run the contents of
`env.jl`. 
The Julia package manager will then create a Julia environment
satisfying the dependencies in the working directory.

3. Usage

Open the Jupyter notebooks with `.ipynb` extensions.
Adapt paths to your local environment. Use `.` for the 
current working directory.
If not already running, start a Julia kernel from the pulldown
menu in the notebook.
Run the cells in the .ipynb notebook in order.

4. Support
The authors extend no warantee or expectation of support, 
express or implied, for the contents of this package.

5. Runtime requirements
The code runs on a desktop. 
Runtime requirements (Jupyter, Julia, and code dependencies) are listed above.

6. Contributing

A version-controlled working copy is maintained 
in a private GitHub repository.
